# Competition Submission Read Me

## Overview
Hey there!
Weâ€™re excited to share our submission for the Self-Driving Challenge. As students from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), weâ€™re passionate about diving into the world of autonomous vehicles and demonstrating what weâ€™ve learned.

Our project combines the thrill of hands on learning with the technical depth of Control Systems, especially the fast paced decision making required to keep a self driving car both quick and stable.

What's Included:
This repository contains everything you need to explore our submission:

ðŸ’» The complete source code for our solution

ðŸŽ¥ A recorded video of our system in action

ðŸ“„ Notes and documentation on how to run and understand our approach

We're proud of what weâ€™ve built, and we hope you enjoy checking it out!

## Testing Environment  

- Quanser Interactive Labs Software v2.16  
- Testing was conducted on the QCar Lab PC  
- **YOLOv8** was used to detect stop signs, traffic lights, roundabouts, and yield signs  
- The roadmap-based planning was performed using custom graph utilities (`RoadMap`, `WHMap`)  


## Results  

- Achieved smooth and accurate QCar motion using optimized trajectories  
- Segmented road signs and objects with high reliability using YOLOv8  
- Depth images were used to compute the distance to segmented objects  
- Traffic light and stop sign behavior was correctly handled

## Variations  

- Visual detection may vary depending on hardware (camera quality, lighting)  
- Path behavior may shift with different map scaling or node configurations

  ## Development Process  

1. **Perception Layer**  
   - Integrated YOLOv8 for object segmentation on RGB images  
   - Mapped segmentation masks to depth data for real-world distance estimation  

2. **Planning Layer**  
   - Constructed roadmap-based path planner with A* and Hermite spline trajectory generation  
   - Visualized paths and map overlays using `matplotlib` and `OpenCV`  

3. **Integration**  
   - Combined segmentation with map-based navigation  
   - Developed modular utilities for testing both independently and as a system


  Extra : *******


  
Messing around with Control Systems has been a blast. It's like being in a video game, but way cooler 'cause it's real life!
This challenge has taught us a ton about making split-second decisions, which we're sure will come in handy down the road.
Plus, teaming up with folks from all majors has been a blast. Who knew self-driving cars could bring so many cool people together?
